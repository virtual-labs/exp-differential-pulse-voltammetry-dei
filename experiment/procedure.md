### Requirements: 
Boron Doped Diamond Electrode, Lead Nitrate, Copper Chloride, Cadmium Nitrate, and Ammonium Acetate Buffer.<br>
### Procedure:
●	The boron-doped diamond electrode serves as the working electrode, the counter electrode is a Pt wire, and the reference electrode is an Ag/AgCl electrode.<br>
●	Pour 10 ml of ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) into the electrochemical cell.<br>
●	Add 1.2mg of lead nitrate to a 100 mL volumetric flask and make up with distilled water to prepare the lead nitrate solution.<br>
●	Add 1.2mg of copper chloride to a 100 mL volumetric flask and make up with distilled water to prepare the copper chloride solution.<br>
● Add 1.2mg of cadmium nitrate to a 100 mL volumetric flask and make up with distilled water to prepare the cadmium nitrate solution.<br>
● In the electrochemical cell, add 2ml of lead nitrate solution, copper chloride solution, and cadmium nitrate solution, respectively.<br>
● Using the NOVA 1.11 interface, square wave voltammetry, and differential pulse voltammetry techniques were employed, and voltammograms were recorded.<br>
