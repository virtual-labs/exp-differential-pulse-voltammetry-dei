### Procedure:

●	The boron-doped diamond electrode is used as a working electrode, the counter electrode is a Pt wire, and the reference electrode is Ag/AgCl.
<br>
●	Pour 10 ml of ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) into the cell.
<br>
●	Add 12µg/ml concentration of lead nitrate, copper chloride, and cadmium nitrate solution separately.
<br>
●	Using NOVA 1.11 interface, square wave voltammetry, and differential pulse voltammetry techniques were employed and voltammograms were recorded.
